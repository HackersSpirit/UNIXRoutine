### The Fairy Tale. :star:
One fine afternoon whist me and my Mac :computer: worked on a project we got stuck. 
Stuck becuase of a silly UNIX command. 

...which I had forgotten . :sob:

This misery :scream: :rage: was ten fold when I kept searching the internet :earth_asia: for long long hours. The sun :sunny: set 
and birds :chicken: returned to nests.
I kept searching and after centuries :date: of toils I found it. I found an old dusty website :page_with_curl: in plain HTML riddled with broken CSS 
keeping the precious command. My precious. :ring:

I vowed that day to create a beautiful castle :european_castle: to house my precious. And thus was born *UNIX Routine*. :arrows_counterclockwise:
